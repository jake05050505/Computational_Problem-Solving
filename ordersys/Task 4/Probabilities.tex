Task4\\
The number of defective items being sent by suppliers are a
problem. Tanjiro Safety Products Ltd source their kits from two
suppliers, Uzumaki Safety Suppliers and Khairan Safety
Company.\\
Typically, twenty percent of the models sent by Uzumaki
Safety Suppliers are found to be defective, while ten per cent
of the models sent by Khairan Safety Company are defective.\\\\
If Uzumaki Safety Suppliers supply 1500 kits annually and
Khairan Safety Company 500 kits annually, calculate the
following:\\\\
(a) The probability of receiving a defective item.\\\\
(b) If a defective model is received, what is the probability
that it came from Uzumaki Safety Suppliers?
\\\\
a) $\frac{(0.2*1500)+(0.1*500)}{2000}$=$\frac{350}{2000}$=$\frac{7}{40}$=0.175 (=17.5\%)\\\\
b) P(A$\vert$B)=$\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$ so:
P(Uzumaki$\vert$defective)=$\frac{P(\text{Uzumaki}\cap\text{defective})}{P(\text{defective})}$\\

P(A$\cap$B)=P(A)*P(B$\vert$A) so: 

P(Uzumaki$\cap$defective)=P(Uzumaki)*P(defective$\vert$Uzumaki)\\

P(defective$\vert$Uzumaki)=0.20 and P(Uzumaki) = $\frac{1500}{2000}$=$\frac{3}{4}$=0.75

P(Uzumaki$\vert$defective) = $\frac{P(Uzumaki)*P(defective\vert Uzumaki)}{P(defective)}$\\

= $\frac{0.75*0.20}{0.175}$ = 0.85714285714 \approx 0.857142 (=85.7142\%)
